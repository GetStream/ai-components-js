# [React Native](https://getstream.io/chat/react-native-chat/tutorial/) AI components for Stream Chat

This official repository for Stream Chat's UI components is designed specifically for AI-first applications written in Swift UI. When paired with our real-time [Chat API](https://getstream.io/chat/), it makes integrating with and rendering responses from LLM providers such as ChatGPT, Gemini, Anthropic or any custom backend easier by providing rich with out-of-the-box components able to render Markdown, Code blocks, tables, thinking indicators, images, etc.

To start, this library includes the following components which assist with this task:
- `StreamingMessageView` - a component that is able to render text, markdown and code in real-time, using a typewriter, character-by-character animation, similar to ChatGPT
- `ComposerView` - a fully featured prompt composer with attachments and speech input
- `SpeechToTextButton` - a reusable button that records voice input and streams the recognized transcript back into your UI
- `AITypingIndicatorView` - a component that can display different states of the LLM (thinking, checking external sources, etc)

Our team plans to keep iterating and adding more components over time. If there's a component you use every day in your apps and would like to see added, please open an issue and we will take it into consideration.

## 🛠️ Installation

The `@stream-io/ai-components-react-native` SDK is available on NPM.

To install it and its peer dependencies, you may run the following command:

```bash
yarn add @stream-io/ai-components-react-native react-native-reanimated react-native-worklets react-native-gesture-handler react-native-svg victory-native @shopify/react-native-skia @babel/plugin-proposal-export-namespace-from
```

After this finishes, you'll need to add the respective `babel` plugins to your `babel.config.js` file, like so:

```js
module.exports = {
  presets: ['module:@react-native/babel-preset'],
  plugins: [
    // ... rest of your @babel plugins
    '@babel/plugin-proposal-export-namespace-from',
    // react-native-worklets/plugin has to be the last one
    'react-native-worklets/plugin',
  ],
};
```

Finally, in order for the speech-to-text feature to work you will need toa add the required capabilities.

#### `iOS`

Within `Info.plist`:

```txt
<key>NSMicrophoneUsageDescription</key>
<string>$(PRODUCT_NAME) would like to access your microphone to capture your voice.</string>
<key>NSSpeechRecognitionUsageDescription</key>
<string>$(PRODUCT_NAME) would like to access speech recognition to transcribe your voice.</string>
```

The text you pick for the capabilities is up to you.

#### `Android`

Within `android/app/AndroidManifest.xml`:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.RECORD_AUDIO" />
```

## Optional features

Additionally, you may also include the optional dependencies that enable pluggable features.

### Media Picker

The media picker feature allows you to pick existing images and take photos with your camera and then use them directly.

The SDK has built-in support for 2 libraries that allow you to achieve this:

#### `react-native-image-picker`

This RN CLI library is meant to be used in vanilla React Native projects. 

To install it, you can run: 

```bash
yarn add react-native-image-picker
```

Please note that for the image capture capabilities to work, you'll also need to include the following permissions:

`Info.plist`:

```txt
<key>NSCameraUsageDescription</key>
<string>$(PRODUCT_NAME) would like to use your camera to share an image in a message.</string>
```

`AndroidManifest.xml`:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.CAMERA" />
```

respectively.

#### `expo-image-picker`

This `Expo` library is meant to be used in `Expo` projects.

To install it, you can run:

```bash
npx expo install expo-image-picker
```

Then, you can refer to [their documentation about adding permissions](https://docs.expo.dev/versions/latest/sdk/imagepicker/#example-appjson-with-config-plugin) and add the `photosPermission` and `cameraPermission` fields.

### Clipboard

The clipboard feature allows you to copy the code within markdown codeblocks if they are rendered.

The SDK has built-in support for 2 libraries that allow you to achieve this:

- `@react-native-clipboard/clipboard` (for RN CLI apps)
- `expo-clipboard` (for `Expo` apps)

## ⚙️ Usage

All of the components listed below are designed to work seamlessly with our existing React Native [Chat SDK](https://getstream.io/chat/react-native-chat/tutorial/). Our [developer guide](https://getstream.io/chat/solutions/ai-integration/) explains how to get started building AI integrations with Stream.

In order to use them, they have to be wrapped within our `StreamTheme` provider that will make sure theming is applied to them. It is recommended that you put the provider somewhere high up in the component tree so that it encapsulates all components used downstream.

### `StreamingMessageView`

The `StreamingMessageView` is a component that can render markdown content efficiently. It has code syntax highlighting, supporting all the major languages. It can render most of the standard markdown content, such as tables, inline code, headings, lists etc.

Under the hood, it implements a letter-by-letter typewriter animation with a character queue, similar to ChatGPT.

#### Example

Provided below is an example of how to use the component.

```tsx
const markdownText = ```
# Heading

some text

## Another heading
```;

<StreamingMessageView 
  text={markdownText}
  letterInterval={5} // every 5ms
  renderingLetterCount={3} // render 3 letters at a time
/>
```
### `AITypingIndicatorView`

The `AITypingIndicatorView` is used to represent different states of the LLM, such as `Thinking`, `Checking External Sources` and so on, depending on the states you've defined on your backend. The only thing that needs to be passed to the component is the `text` property, which will then be displayed with a shimmering animation.


| Name    | Type     | Required | Description                                          |
|---------|----------|----------|------------------------------------------------------|
| `text`  | `string` | yes      | The text we want to be displayed inside of the view. |

#### Example

```tsx
<AITypingIndivacorView text={'Thinking of an answer...'} />
```

### `ComposerView`

The `ComposerView` gives users a modern text entry surface with attachment previews, actionable bottom sheet, speech-to-text button and an integrated send button.


| Name                 | Type                                                                                                                                                                                        | Required | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |

#### Example

```tsx
import { useSafeAreaInsets } from 'react-native-safe-area-context';

const options = [
  {
    title: 'Create Image',
    subtitle: 'Visualize anything',
    action: () => Alert.alert('Pressed on Create Image !'),
    Icon: DownloadArrow,
  },
  {
    title: 'Thinking',
    subtitle: 'Think longer for better answers',
    action: () => Alert.alert('Pressed on Thinking !'),
    Icon: Flag,
  }
]

const insets = useSafeAreaInsets();

<ComposerView
  onSendMessage={sendMessage}
  bottomSheetOptions={bottomSheetOptions}
  bottomSheetInsets={insets}
/>
```

### `SpeechToTextButton`

The `SpeechToTextButton` turns voice input into text using native implementations of the iOS and Android speech frameworks, respectively. When tapped it asks for microphone access, records audio and forwards the recognized transcript to the `ComposerState` directly.

It uses the `useDictation` hook under the hood, which can also be used without the button as well for voice transcription purposes outside of the button.

It takes a single property named `options` that has the following keys:

| Name                  | Type       | Required | Description                                                                                                                                                                        |
|-----------------------|------------|----------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `language`            | `string`   | no       | The language we want to transcribe from. It will default to `en-US`.                                                                                                               |
| `intermediateResults` | `boolean`  | no       | A boolean signifying whether we want to receive the intermediate results from the transcription or just the final result when the transcription is deemed done. Defaults to `true` |
| `silenceTimeoutMs`    | `number`   | no       | A number signifying the number of milliseconds of silence until transcription is deemed finished. Defaults to `2500`.                                                              |


```tsx
const options = {
  language: 'de-DE', // set the language to german
  intermediateResults: false, // disable intermediate results and only use the final results
  silenceTimeoutMs: 3500 // set the silence timeout to 3.5 seconds
}
<SpeechToTextButton options={options} />
```

The `SpeechToTextButton` is already integrated within the `ComposerView`, however you can feel free to use it elsewhere as well.

### Theming

Each one of the components in the SDK is fully theme-compatible. The `StreamTheme` provider takes care of this for you.

In order to modify the theme, you may refer to our full fledged theme object [as seen here](https://github.com/GetStream/ai-components-js/blob/main/packages/react-native-sdk/src/theme.ts).

#### Example

In the example below, we introduce a dark color scheme through the theming system.

```tsx
const customTheme = { 
  colors: colorScheme === 'dark' 
    ? {
      accent_blue: '#4C9DFF',
      accent_red: '#FF636E',
      black: '#FFFFFF',
      code_block: '#1E1E22',
      grey: '#A1A1AA',
      grey_neutral: '#C5C5C8',
      grey_dark: '#71717A',
      grey_gainsboro: '#3F3F46',
      grey_whisper: '#27272F',
      overlay: '#000000CC',
      transparent: 'transparent',
      white: '#050509',
      white_smoke: '#121214',
      shimmer: '#FFFFFF',
    } : {}
}

<StreamTheme style={customTheme}>{children}</StreamTheme>
```
